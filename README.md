# DICEFARM

DICEFARM is used in two projects: (1) The high climate costs of animal based foods (EKM) and (2) Optimal Animal Agriculture Under Environmental and Population Externalities (SCW). 

The model itself is constructed in DICEFARM.jl; and the modifications for SCW are located in "AnimalWefareModel.jl" in the "Subroutines_SCW" folder.
